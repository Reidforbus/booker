### Appointment booking tool

This repo holds my student project for the University of Helsinki course Tietokannat ja web-ohjelmointi

My plan is to create a appointment scheduling program where a business can provide services for their customers to book appointments for.
The owner/admin is able to:
- WIP Create different services with custom description and duration
- WIP Set time windows within which services can be booked
- WIP Manage active bookings

A user/client is able to:
- WIP Browse available services
- WIP Book services and add messages to bookings
- WIP Review and edit their bookings

My plan is to implement this application as a bike shop service scheduler
